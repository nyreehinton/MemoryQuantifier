Below are definitions and explanations of **pecuniary (economic) damages** under the specified California and federal laws, as well as the concept of **Good Faith & Fair Dealing**. Pecuniary damages generally refer to monetary losses that can be quantified, such as lost income, costs incurred, or other financial harm. Each statute or legal principle has its own context for how such damages may apply:

---

### 1. **UCL (California Business & Professions Code § 17200) - Unfair Competition Law**

- **Definition of Pecuniary Damages**: Under the UCL, pecuniary damages refer to actual economic losses suffered by a plaintiff due to unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practices. These might include lost money or property as a direct result of the defendant's actions.
- **Context**: The UCL allows private plaintiffs to seek restitution (money or property lost) and injunctive relief, but _not_ compensatory or punitive damages beyond restitution. Pecuniary damages must be tied to an identifiable economic harm (e.g., overpayments, lost business opportunities) caused by the unfair practice.
- **Key Limitation**: Courts require that the plaintiff show a causal connection between the defendant’s conduct and the economic loss, and the remedy is limited to restitution rather than speculative or non-economic damages.

### 2. **CCRAA (California Civil Code § 1785) - California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act**

- **Definition of Pecuniary Damages**: Under the CCRAA, pecuniary damages include quantifiable financial losses resulting from violations of credit reporting rules, such as inaccurate reporting by a credit agency. Examples include lost credit opportunities, higher interest rates, or costs to correct errors.
- **Context**: Section 1785.31 allows consumers to recover "actual damages" (which include pecuniary losses) caused by negligent or willful violations of the Act. If willful, punitive damages may also be awarded, but pecuniary damages specifically focus on measurable economic harm.
- **Key Feature**: The plaintiff must demonstrate a direct economic injury stemming from the violation, such as being denied a loan or incurring fees due to inaccurate credit information.

### 3. **FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681) - Fair Credit Reporting Act**

- **Definition of Pecuniary Damages**: Under the FCRA, pecuniary damages encompass economic losses caused by violations of federal credit reporting laws, such as inaccurate reporting, failure to investigate disputes, or improper disclosure of credit information. Examples include lost employment opportunities, loan denials, or financial costs to repair credit.
- **Context**: Sections 1681n (willful violations) and 1681o (negligent violations) allow recovery of "actual damages," which include pecuniary losses. For willful violations, statutory damages ($100-$1,000 per violation) and punitive damages may also apply, but pecuniary damages require proof of tangible economic harm.
- **Key Requirement**: The plaintiff must show a concrete financial injury tied to the violation, not just emotional distress (though emotional damages may supplement pecuniary losses).

### 4. **RFDCPA (California Civil Code § 1788) - Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act**

- **Definition of Pecuniary Damages**: Under the RFDCPA, pecuniary damages refer to economic losses caused by unlawful debt collection practices, such as harassment, false representations, or improper collection efforts. This could include money paid under duress, costs to defend against wrongful collection, or lost income due to collection-related stress.
- **Context**: Section 1788.30 allows recovery of "actual damages" for violations, which encompass pecuniary losses. For intentional violations, statutory damages up to $1,000 per action may also be awarded, but pecuniary damages must be proven with evidence of financial harm.
- **Key Note**: Economic damages must be directly linked to the debt collector’s misconduct, such as payments made due to deceptive practices.

### 5. **Good Faith & Fair Dealing**

- **Definition**: The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a legal principle in contract law that requires parties to act honestly and fairly to ensure the other party receives the benefits of the agreement. It doesn’t directly define pecuniary damages but provides a basis for claiming them when breached.
- **Pecuniary Damages Context**: If a party breaches this covenant (e.g., by sabotaging a contract’s purpose), pecuniary damages could include lost profits, wasted expenditures, or other financial losses caused by the bad-faith conduct.
- **Application**: In California, this covenant is implied in every contract. For example, if an insurer denies a claim in bad faith, the insured might recover pecuniary damages like unpaid benefits or consequential economic losses (e.g., foreclosure due to non-payment).
- **Key Limitation**: Damages must be foreseeable and proximately caused by the breach of good faith, often requiring a showing of specific economic harm.
