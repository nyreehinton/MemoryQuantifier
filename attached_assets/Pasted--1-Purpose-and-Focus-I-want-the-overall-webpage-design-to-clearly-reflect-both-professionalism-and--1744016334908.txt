	1.	Purpose and Focus
I want the overall webpage design to clearly reflect both professionalism and urgency. The immediate goal is to attract potential new counsel by demonstrating a concise overview of the case’s critical details, while also communicating that I am a well-prepared, detail-oriented client. The user interface should make it easy for attorneys to quickly assess the case background, timeline, and supporting documents so they can see the potential merits and scope of representation.
	2.	Color Palette and Typography
Utilize a professional, muted color palette—like dark blues, grays, and subtle neutrals—to convey seriousness and credibility. These tones should be balanced with occasional bold accents (such as a well-placed contrasting color) to draw attention to urgent or high-value items (e.g., urgent deadlines, key case milestones). Typography should be crisp, readable, and modern, such as a clean sans-serif font for headings and a serif or complementary sans-serif font for body text, ensuring clarity and visual hierarchy throughout.
	3.	Layout and Information Hierarchy
Structure the webpage in a logical, streamlined manner that places key case information front and center. For example, begin with a succinct summary of the case issues and next deadlines, followed by a clearly labeled timeline of major events. Beneath the timeline, organize sections for case documents, settlement details, and potential damages, each outlined with short descriptive headers. Make frequent use of visual cues—such as icons or separators—to delineate sections and sub-sections.
	4.	Interactive Elements and Highlights
Incorporate interactive, collapsible modules or accordions that expand to reveal more detailed information about each phase of the case. This makes it simple for prospective counsel to drill down into specifics (like the complaints, settlement documentation, or financial statements) without being overwhelmed by too much text at once. Include call-to-action buttons or banners (e.g., “Click Here to Review Key Documents” or “Learn More About the Damages”) that stand out through color or subtle animations, signaling the most critical areas that need the lawyer’s attention.
	5.	Establishing Credibility and Readiness
Finally, the design should include a brief but powerful introductory block or banner that frames the professional nature of the case. This might highlight prior litigation efforts, settlements reached, and the plaintiff’s readiness to cooperate fully with new counsel. Showcase a clear “I am prepared and sophisticated” message by referencing organized financials, properly stored documents, or curated notes. In short, the visual design must lend immediate trust and urgency, ensuring prospective attorneys feel confident that representing this case is both worthwhile and well-supported.
