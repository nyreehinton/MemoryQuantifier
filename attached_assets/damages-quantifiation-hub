Structure and components controlling the Damages Quantification Hub. Here's the complete breakdown:

1. **Main Page Component**:
   `client/src/pages/damages-quantification.tsx` - This is the parent page that:

- Renders the main layout
- Includes the header with "Export" and "Add Claim" buttons
- Imports and renders the main `DamagesHub` component

2. **Core Hub Component**:
   `client/src/components/dashboard/damages-hub.tsx` - This is the main component that:

- Fetches data from two API endpoints:
  - `/api/damages` - Gets all damage claims
  - `/api/adverse-actions` - Gets all adverse actions
- Manages the tab state for different damage categories
- Renders the following sections:
  - Overview tab with damages summary
  - Individual category tabs (PEC-PAY, PEC-COST, etc.)
  - Documentation status chart
  - Critical documentation needs

3. **Data Source**:
   `server/api/damages.ts` - This file contains all the damage claims data, including:

- Individual claims for each category
- Required documentation for each claim
- Status tracking
- Source document references

4. **Issue with PEC-COST Claims**:
   The reason you're not seeing all the PEC-COST claims is due to how the `getDamagesByCategory` function filters the data in `damages-hub.tsx`. Let me show you the relevant section:

```typescript:client/src/components/dashboard/damages-hub.tsx
const getDamagesByCategory = (category: string) => {
  if (category === 'overview') return [];
  return damages.filter((d) => d.category === category);
};
```
