Case Overview

This case centers on Capital One Financial Corporation’s alleged retaliatory conduct following Plaintiff Nyree Hinton’s initial lawsuit against the company in July 2023. In a direct and punitive response, Capital One restricted Plaintiff’s access to his online account and falsely reported his Tesla auto loan as delinquent and subsequently charged-off—despite ongoing disputes and communications. These derogatory credit entries triggered a cascade of financial, professional, and personal consequences that continue to reverberate.

Between late 2023 and early 2025, Mr. Hinton experienced 43 separate adverse credit actions across more than two dozen financial institutions, all referencing Capital One’s delinquency reporting. These included auto loan and education financing denials, drastic credit line reductions, punitive rental terms, and an inability to refinance or secure new credit. Among the most severe outcomes was the forced withdrawal from Harvard Extension School due to the loss of educational financing—an event with lifelong economic and psychological implications.

But the damages go far beyond credit score points and loan rejections. Mr. Hinton, who had maintained an impeccable credit history for over a decade, was thrust into a costly and emotionally draining process of regaining control over his financial identity. He has been forced to document, dispute, and remediate inaccurate data with banks, lenders, rental agencies, and even prospective employers. These events unfolded in parallel with the birth of his child in September 2023, magnifying the stress and instability during what should have been a time of security and support for his growing family.

Despite settlements with all three major credit bureaus, the case against Capital One remains ongoing. To date, no resolution has been reached for the direct harm their reporting caused. The plaintiff has presented detailed quantification of economic loss exceeding $2.57 million—supported by exhibits, adverse action notices, and a present-value calculation of lost educational opportunity alone amounting to over $1.1 million.

Mr. Hinton’s current counsel withdrew immediately after a failed mediation session on April 3, 2025—despite prior inquiries regarding their commitment to litigation if mediation failed. As such, Mr. Hinton now seeks successor counsel who can see the gravity, credibility, and litigation value of this case. He brings to the table not only a strong factual record and a well-organized evidence base but a lived experience of systemic credit harm that continues to affect his life, family, and future every day.
