- Main page component
- Contains the header with "Credit Reports Tracker" title
- Includes filter and add report buttons
- Renders the CreditReportsTable component

2. **Table Component**
   `typescript:client/src/components/dashboard/credit-reports-table.tsx`

- Displays the credit reports data in a table format
- Uses React Query to fetch data from the API
- Shows ID, Agency, Date Range, Reason, Status, Linked Docs, and Notes
- Uses various UI components from the components/ui directory

3. **API Layer**
   `typescript:server/api/creditReports.ts`

- Contains the credit reports data
- Exports `creditReportsData` array with all credit report needs
- Data is organized by status (Satisfied, Partially Satisfied, Outstanding)
- Includes detailed notes and document links

4. **Types**
   `typescript:shared/schema.ts` (or similar)

- Contains shared type definitions like `CreditReport` interface
- Used by both client and server code
- Defines the structure of credit report data

5. **UI Components**
   `typescript:client/src/components/ui/`

- `table.tsx` - Base table components
- `status-badge.tsx` - Status indicator badges
- `badge.tsx` - Used for document links
- Other UI utilities

6. **Data Sources**

- `attached_assets/documents/credit-reports/` - Contains actual credit report files
  - `experian/` - Contains Experian reports from various dates
  - `cr-need-02.json` - Detailed credit report data
  - `baseline-01` - Baseline credit report data

7. **State Management**

- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Query key: `['/api/credit-reports']`
- Handles loading states

8. **Styling**

- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling (configured in `tailwind.config.ts`)
- Custom UI components follow a consistent design system
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

9. **Project Configuration**

- `vite.config.ts` - Build and development server configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

10. **Data Flow**

```
[Credit Report Files]
       ↓
[Server API Layer]
       ↓
[React Query Cache]
       ↓
[CreditReportsTable]
       ↓
[UI Components]
```

11. **Key Features**

- Real-time data fetching
- Status tracking for each credit report need
- Document linking and context tracking
- Notes and date tracking
- Filtering capability (UI ready)
- Add report capability (UI ready)

12. **Future Enhancement Points**

- Filter functionality implementation
- Add report form implementation
- Status update functionality
- Document upload integration
- Real-time updates

The system is built with a clear separation of concerns:

- Data management in the API layer
- UI components for presentation
- Type safety throughout
- Clear data flow from server to UI
- Extensible architecture for future features
